# Simple-RAG-Langchain

This repository explores the use of LangChain for building Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems and AI chatbots. 

**Key Features:**

* **RAG Implementations:** 
    - Various RAG architectures are explored, including basic RAG, RAG with metadata, and different retrieval strategies.
    - Examples of RAG in action for answering questions and engaging in conversations.
* **Chatbot Development:**
    - Chatbot implementations with varying levels of sophistication.
    - Integration with external services like Firebase for conversation storage.
* **Text Splitting:**
    - Techniques for effectively splitting text for RAG systems.

**Repository Structure:**

* **`data`:** Contains data used for the projects, such as documents for RAG systems.
* **`db`:** Stores any database files used by the projects.
* **`scripts`:** Contains scripts for data processing, model training, or other tasks.
* **`notebooks`:** Jupyter notebooks for exploratory analysis and experiments.
* **`models`:** Stores trained models or checkpoints.


**Getting Started:**

1. **Clone the repository:**
